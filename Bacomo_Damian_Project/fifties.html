<b>Description</b><br>
The music in the 1950s was influenced by World War II and great depression. There were many remarkable cultural changes that happened. The music in the 1950s reflected racial tensions since those tensions were being strained with the beginning of civil rights movements. African-American musicians became prominent because of R&B and Rock ‘n’ Roll. Other genres that popularized in the 1950s are Blues, Traditional Pop, Country Music, Rockabilly, Doo-wop, Blue Grass and the Gospel.

<a name="bye"><b>Bye Bye Love - The Everly Brothers</b></a>

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

I'm-a through with romance, I'm a-through with love
I'm through with a-countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye

Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye

A well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

My hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

Please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

My tongue get tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
I'm all shook up

<a name="why"><b>Why Do Fools Fall In Love</b></a>

Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Oh, love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why, why, why
Tell me why

Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
Oh, why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
And before I know, it will reach defeat
Tell my why, oh why, oh why, why do they fall in love?
Oh, why do fools fall in love?
